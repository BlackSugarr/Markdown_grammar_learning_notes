##Try to use MacDown
I used Mou as my Markdown editor, but it sometimes or always delays for minutes when I save the doc.<br/>
So I try to use MacDown.<br/>
I like it.
This is the home page of [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/).<br/>
Furthermore, there is a [comparison of MacDown and Mou](http://www.jianshu.com/p/6c157af09e84).
